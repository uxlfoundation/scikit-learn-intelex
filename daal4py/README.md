# daal4py - A Convenient Python API to the Intel(R) oneAPI Data Analytics Library
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/daal/daal4py/_apis/build/status/CI?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/daal/daal4py/_build/latest?definitionId=9&branchName=main)

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: `daal4py` has been merged into `scikit-learn-intelex`. As of version 2025.0, it is distributed as an additional importable module within the package `scikit-learn-intelex` instead of being a separate package. The last standalone release of `daal4py` was version 2024.7, and this standalone package will not receive further updates.

A simplified API to Intel(R) oneAPI Data Analytics Library that allows for fast usage of the framework suited for Data Scientists or Machine Learning users.  Built to help provide an abstraction to Intel(R) oneAPI Data Analytics Library for either direct usage or integration into one's own framework.

Note: For the most part, `daal4py` is used as an internal backend within the Intel(R) Scikit-Learn extension, and it is highly recommended to use `sklearnex` instead. Nevertheless, some functionalities from `daal4py` can still be of use, and the module can still be imported directly (`import daal4py`) after installing `scikit-learn-intelex`.

# üõ† Installation

Daal4Py is distributed as part of scikit-learn-intelex, which itself is distributed under different channels.

See the [installation instructions for scikit-learn-intelex](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/scikit-learn-intelex/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for details.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: *GPU and MPI support are optional dependencies.
Required dependencies for GPU and MPI support will not be downloaded.
You need to manually install `dpcpp_cpp_rt` and `dpctl` packages for GPU support, and `mpi4py` with `impi_rt` as backend package for MPI support.*

<details><summary>[Click to expand] ‚ÑπÔ∏è How to install dpcpp_cpp_rt and impi_rt packages </summary>

```shell
# PyPi for dpcpp
pip install -U dpcpp_cpp_rt dpctl
```

```shell
# PyPi for MPI
pip install -U mpi4py impi_rt
```

```shell
# Anaconda Cloud for dpcpp
conda install dpcpp_cpp_rt dpctl -c https://software.repos.intel.com/python/conda/
```

```shell
# Anaconda Cloud for MPI
conda install mpi4py impi_rt -c https://software.repos.intel.com/python/conda/
```

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Scikit-learn patching

Scikit-learn patching functionality in daal4py was deprecated and moved to a separate package - [Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn*](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/scikit-learn-intelex). All future updates for the patching will be available in Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn only. Please use the package instead of daal4py for the Scikit-learn acceleration.
