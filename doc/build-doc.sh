# Build comes in two variants:
# - As a standalone doc (for local development and CI)
# - As a versioned build (for the deployed docs), triggerable by
#   passing argument '--gh-pages'.
# In the first case, it will generate a page under '_build' with
# an 'html' folder and a separate 'doctrees'. Only the 'html' part
# is needed to render the docs locally.
# In the second case, it will generate a versioned entry (year.month)
# under '_build', with the doctrees inside that versioned folder.
# Those are directly copyable to the 'gh-pages' branch to be deployed.
