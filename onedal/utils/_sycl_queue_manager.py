    Context manager to manage the global SyclQueue.

    This context manager updates the global queue with the provided queue,
    verifies that all data objects are on the same device, and restores the
    original queue after work is done.
    Note: For most applications, the original queue should be `None`, but
            if there are nested calls to `manage_global_queue()`, it is
            important to restore the outer queue, rather than setting it to
            `None`.

    Parameters:
    queue (SyclQueue or None): The queue to set as the global queue. If None,
                                the global queue will be determined from the provided data.
    *args: Additional data objects to verify their device placement.

    Yields:
    SyclQueue: The global queue after verification.
